thoughts about updating permissions to be more useful

groups:
    a collection of users that have a shared list of permissions
    a single user can belong to multiple groups
    a group can contain many users
    a group can have many permissions

    tables:
        groups:
            id: integer incremental primary key
            name: string not null unique

        group_users:
            group_id: integer not null
            user_id: integer not null

permissions:
    defines an ability of a user or group
    a user can have multiple permissions
    a group can have multiple permissions

    tables:
        permissions:
            subject_table: string not null
            subject_id: integer not null
            roll: string not null
            ability: string not null
            resource_table: string not null
            resource_id: integer not null

    roles:
        "entries" allows for a user to read/write their own entries
        "users" allows for a user to read/write to other users in the system
            only updating information about the user, not the users entries
        "users/entries" allow for a user to read other users entries
        "users/entries/comments" allow for a user to read/write comments to a users entries
